## How it works

A T flip-flop, also known as a toggle flip-flop, is a type of
sequential logic circuit that changes its output state (toggles) when
triggered by a clock pulse and its input, labeled "tin", is high (1).
If the "tin" input is low (0), the flip-flop holds its previous output
state. Essentially, it acts as a controlled switch that toggles its
output on and off based on the "tin" input and clock signal.

## How to test

Refer to the state table of t flip flop. Observe if the output is
correctly changing based on the input and clock pulse.

## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
none!
